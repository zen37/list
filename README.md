# Array Utils

This Python script provides a function `remove_duplicates` to remove duplicate elements from a list

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/array-utils.git
    cd array-utils
    ```

2. Install pytest:

    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

3. Run the tests:

    ```bash
    pytest -v test_array_utils.py
    ```

   The `-v` flag is optional but provides verbose output.

   Here's a breakdown of some commonly used `-r` options:

   - `-r a`: Show all available information (default).
   - `-r A`: Show even more information, including all the available extra information.
   - `-r s`: Show short information, just summary lines for each test.
   - `-r x`: Show only failed and xfailed tests.
   - `-r X`: Show only passed and xpassed tests.
   - `-r f`: Show only failed tests.
   - `-r E`: Show only tests with errors.
   - `-r P`: Show passing tests with captured output.

## Example Usage

```python
from array_utils import remove_duplicates
